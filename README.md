sometimes you see a library and go "yeah but how would I actually *use* this in practice?". 

that happens for a lot of reasons. maybe it's abstract. maybe it introduces itself by throwing buzzwords at you.

but then one day it clicks. you start tentatively integrating it into a couple projects. then another. and another. 

the library becomes a hammer, everything becomes a nail, and boy do you know how to swing it.

and by the end, you wonder how you ever did anything without it.

this comes at a steep cost.

your code becomes alien to the uninitiated. outsiders peer at it with wonder, awe, and a little bit of terror.

and what's worse, you can't explain it to them. as a programmer, you're used to being excited about abstractions. loving them, fighting over them, the full splendour of the emotional spectrum applied to things five layers of type theory away from reality. 

but this something else entirely. to you, this is the abstraction that subsumes everything else, the mother of all metanarratives, as close to communion with the cosmos as you can get.

this is one of those libraries. i hope you get as much use out of it as i do.

more to come.
